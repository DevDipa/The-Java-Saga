# **Selection Sort**
- `The idea here is to select an element from the Unsorted portion of the array, and place it in its correct position via swapping.`

## **Steps**
*Note: This one's for an ascending sorting.*
- Iterate from 0 through (arr.length - 1). 
 - Get the index of the last element of the Unsorted portion.
 - Get the index of the maximum element within the Unsorted portion.
 - Swap the maximum element with the last element.
