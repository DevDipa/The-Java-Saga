# **Java LinkedList**
- Almost identical to the ArrayList.
- *import java.util.LinkedList;*
- The elements are placed in the form of CONTAINERS; each container has an element and a link to the next container. 

# **Java Set**
- Set is an interface that doesn't allow duplicates.
- Classes that implement Set are: HashSet, TreeSet and LinkedHashSet.
- Common methods are: add(), remove(), contains(), size(), clear(), etc.
- No Index-based access.
- HashSet is fast and unordered.
- TreeSet is sorted.
- LinkedHashSet is ordered by insertion.

# **Java Map**
- Stores key-vlaue pairs; *each key must be unique but values can be duplicated.*
- Common Classes:
  - HashMap -> fast and unorodered.
  - TreeMap -> sorted by key.
  - LinkedHashMap -> ordered by insertion.
- Common Methods: put(), get(), remove(), containsKey(), keySet(), etc.
