#Java Applet
- An applet is a special kind of Java program that is designed to be transmitted over the Internet and automatically executed inside a Java-compatible web browser.
- It is a dynamic, self-executing program.
- It is an active agent on the client computer, yet it is initiated by the server.

#The Bytecode
- When the Java compiler compiles a Java program, the result is called a Bytecode.
- Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by the Java run-time system, which is called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- The bytecode remains the same, only the JVM differs according to the platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
