# **Recursion**

## **Background**
- Function Calls go into the Stack Memory.
- While the function is executing, it remains in the Stack itself.
- When it is done executing, it is removed from there, and the program flow is restored where it was called from.

## **Context**
- Recursion is when a function calls itself.
- `Here, every time a function calls itself, a separate memory is allocated in the Stack.`
- `Base Condition` is required to prevent Stack Overflow.

## **Pros**
- Helps in solving complex problem by breaking it down into simpler ones.
- Solution is convertable into Iteration and vice versa.
